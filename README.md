Code Commits to capture changes of the Balancing bot created at the Makers Asylum.

Set I and D term to 0, and adjust P so that the
robot starts to oscillate (move back and forth)
about the balance position. P should be large
enough for the robot to move but not too large
otherwise the movement would not be smooth.

With P set, increase I so that the robot accelerates
faster when off balance. With P and I properly
tuned, the robot should be able to self-balance for
at least a few seconds.

Finally, increase D so that the robot would move
about its balanced position more gentle, and there
shouldnâ€™t be any significant overshoots.
